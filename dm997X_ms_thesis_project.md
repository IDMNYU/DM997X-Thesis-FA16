# THESIS PROJECT

You should be [conducting research](dm997X_ms_thesis_research.md) and user testing throughout the ENTIRE semester. Do not wait until the last minute to begin user testing; User testing gives you invaluable feedback about your project. Include the results of your user testing in your thesis paper.

## Assignment: Project Milestones
Break down your milestones into actionable tasks using a system of your choice. All actionable tasks should start with a verb (i.e. write, call, email, build, collect, etc.), and can be completed in a day. Also be specific with your tasks. *(For example, "take 20 photographs" is more explicit than "take photographs". "Take 5 photos of tigers, 5 photos of bears, 5 photos of lizards, and 5 photos of cats" is more explicit than "take 20 photographs".)*

    Alpha, Beta, and Gold refer to a project’s life cycle. The specific parameters and expectations of each version will be individually determined in consultation with the professor.

## Assignment: Alpha Version of Project
<strong>Alpha</strong> is the testing phase of form and functionality for your project.

## Assignment: Beta Version of Project
<strong>Beta</strong> is when the functionality, form, and implementation of your project is complete as possible. It is ready for user testing.

## Assignment: Gold Version of Project
