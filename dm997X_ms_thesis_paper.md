# THESIS PAPER GUIDELINES

For standard formatting, consult Master's Thesis and Project Guidelines_March2014 version.pdf, the word templates, as well as [Succeeding with your master's dissertation a step-by-step handbook](https://getit.library.nyu.edu/go/6809674) by John Biggam (available for download via Bobst's ebrary).

What do I mean by COMPILED thesis paper? 
* The body AND the preliminaries (most notably the Table of Contents) in one pdf. 
* Consult the templates 
 *https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B4nUNuLrhw35MDhpa3JSUDFrNTA
* Also make sure you include your name in the filename of any file you submit to someone else. I'm getting a lot of thesispaper.pdf but once I download them to my computer I don't know whose paper it is until I open it. Imagine receiving 100 resumes named resume.pdf.

**<font color="#ff0000">Please have someone other than yourself read and edit all of your writing before you turn it in.</font>** (Even better, have someone read your writing out loud to you.) Include that person's name [and their title and/or relationship with you (if not your accountability partner or other classmate)] at the top of each paper assignment as Editor.

## Assignment: The “elevator pitch” / Thesis Statement
Read [Indiana University's How To Write a Thesis Statement](http://www.indiana.edu/~wts/pamphlets/thesis_statement.shtml) BEFORE you write your thesis statement.

* First, ask yourself what question is your research trying to answer? (Please reference the above link.)
* Secondly, turn that question into a statement. (Please reference the above link.)
* Do not use **I** in your thesis statement.

Here's a guide for a starting point: 

***(Working Title)* is a *(What is it?)* that *(What does it do?)* for *(Your Audience)* to *(Why? What's the purpose)*.** 

*Note: Obviously you would not leave in the parentheses; it's a just a marker to denote what you should add.*



## Assignment: Visual Outline or Mind Map
Read [Columbia University's Skimming vs. Reading](http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/~martins/sen_sem/thesis_org.html#Skimming) and [Columbia University's Order of Writing](http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/~martins/sen_sem/thesis_org.html#Order) at http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/~martins/sen_sem/thesis_org.html BEFORE creating your visual outline. Use the figures, graphs, and illustrations you will use in your paper. This visual outline will also be extremely helpful in your project presentations and (mock) thesis defenses. 


### Assignment: Written Outline
Read [Indiana University's Using Outlines](http://www.indiana.edu/~wts/pamphlets/outlines.shtml), BEFORE you write your outline.

## Assignment: Detailed Written Outline
Review [Indiana University's Using Outlines](http://www.indiana.edu/~wts/pamphlets/outlines.shtml), BEFORE you write your detailed outline. 

Recommended: Wed, September 28th // Submit detailed outline to Liz 

Create a more detailed written outline by fleshing out they key points of your topics and/or subtopics of your initial written outline.

## Assignment: Body 

I recommend you use some sort of version control for keeping track of drafts of your writing. 
* I'd recommend writing your paper using **github** (the best version control out there.)
* Secondly, I'd recommend **google drive** (where you can roll back to different versions)
* Worst case scenario, would be creating **manual version control by duplicating your word processing (MS Word, Pages, etc.) file and adding the date to each major draft**.

Recommended: Meet with Liz prior to submission of thesis draft to discuss detailed outline and / or to review section drafts

## Assignment: Proofread & TurnItIn
BEFORE you proofread, read: 
* [Indiana University's Proofreading for Common Surface Errors: Spelling, Punctuation, and Grammar](http://www.indiana.edu/~wts/pamphlets/proofing_grammar.shtml)

Use [TurnItIn](https://newclasses.nyu.edu) in NYU Classes to check for plagarism or mistakes in references/citations. 

TurnItIn is the originality detection service available through NYU Classes. Before using TurnItIn, it is important to understand the implications under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA) regarding student work. Once a student submits an assignment or a piece of work to an instructor, this work then is considered an education record under FERPA. (For more information regarding FERPA at NYU, please see www.nyu.edu/about/policies-guidelines-compliance/policies-and-guidelines/FERPA.html.)

In order to adhere to FERPA guidelines, there are two possible approaches to submitting student work to an originality detection service:

<li>Students submit their own work
This is the case with the integration between NYU Classes and the Assignments tool (www.nyu.edu/servicelink/041223513203041), where students may submit their work directly to TurnItIn. Instructors are strongly encouraged to make it clear to the students that TurnItIn will be used at some point within their course. A statement within the course syllabus and/or course description is recommended, as well as verbal reminders, as appropriate. At the time of submission to TurnItIn within NYU Classes, students will be presented with a system notification that TurnItIn will evaluate their work.</li>

<li>Instructor submits student work 
An instructor may submit a piece of a student's work or an entire paper to TurnItIn as long as all personally identifiable information (PII) is redacted from the work. PII includes, but is not limited to: name, identification number, any descriptions of the student that would make him/her identifiable. The method of instructor submission must also be through NYU Classes (www.nyu.edu/servicelink/041223513203041). After receipt of the TurnItIn analysis, the instructor is encouraged to contact the student to discuss the analysis of the work.</li>


**Required deadline: Wed, November 23rd // Submit thesis draft to Liz. Liz will return thesis drafts by Wed, November 30th.** 

Recommended: Liz will review second drafts of thesis papers from November 30th - December 9th. Papers will be returned with comments 2-3 days after they are sent to Liz.
