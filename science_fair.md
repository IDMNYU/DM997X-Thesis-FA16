# PROJECT DEMOS SCIENCE FAIR 

During class you will bring in a working prototype of your project. Not just documentation but something workable from the actual project. 

The class will run as follows :
<li>10 min Group A set up demos</li>
<li>60 min Each person has ten minutes to demo individually to members of Group B. Plan to ask specific questions of the users that come to your table. Rehearse your thesis statement out loud. Use this time to talk about your work. The more you can talk about your research the smoother your defense will go.</li>
<li>10 min Group B set up</li>
<li>60 min Repeat with Group B demos</li>
